# Vision

This project explores agentic commerce augmentation through a layered platform:

1. Research & Ethics Layer (CIT, AIS, Empowerment Theory)
2. Core Platform (CCO) with memory, intent modeling, MCP tools, and product reasoning
3. Demo surfaces that expose the stack through hackathon-ready apps

The repo mirrors that structure so individual layers can evolve independently while still composing into compelling demos.
